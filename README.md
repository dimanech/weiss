Deveolped by Dmytro Nechepurenko. Distributed by MIT license.

Some parts are based on Nicolas Gallagher, Stefan Nitzsche, Tyler Tate work, Yahoo UI, HTML5 Boilerplate, Twitter Bootstrap, Zen, Zurb Foundation and others.

## About

Weiss is HTML5-CSS3 blank canvas sass-middleman helper for fast-start development.
Based around tasks and problems that arise with me every day in my work, so in some case it`s not universal or full production ready framework.

### Main features:

* Not a prototyping tool like Bootstrap or Foundation, just blank canvas
* Middelman/sass/compass
* BEM structure of blocks
* HTML5 semantic markup
* CSS3 ready with mixins for working with vendor prefixes
* Media Query structure and mixins
* WAI ARIA support

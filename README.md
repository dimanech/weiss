Weiss is HTML5-CSS3 blank canvas sass-compass helper with media query and grid system for fast start and easy development.

It is build with HTML 5 and large parts of CSS3, included fluid markup and media queries structure, so you can support mobile devices in one CSS file.
Based around typography and semantic, queries and problems that arise with me every day in my work - so in some cases it is not universal framework.

it has very little deliberate support for IE6.

WEISS

   Deveolped by Dmytro Nechepurenko. Distributed by GNU GPL v.2.
   Based on work Andr√© Griffin (http://andregriffin.com).
   Some parts are based on works Stefan Nitzsche, Tyler Tate, Yahoo UI, and others.

Weiss is HTML5-CSS3 blank canvas sass framework with media query and grid system for fast start and easy development.
Based on Drupal theme Framework (http://drupal.org/project/framework) with some useful improvements.

It is build with HTML 5 and large parts of CSS3, included fluid markup and media queries structure, so you can support mobile devices in one CSS file.
It is based around typography and semantic, queries and problems that arise with me every day in my work. So in some cases it is not universal framework.

it has very little deliberate support for IE6.
